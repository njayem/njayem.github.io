        "I had the pleasure of supervising Nadine in her roles at Facilities Management at Concordia University, where she helped with two of our key reuse operations as part of our Zero Waste program. Nadine is an exceptionally bright individual, whose work ethic and attitude are a rare find. She brought such a positive presence to our team, approaching and developing new processes with a methodical, thoughtful, and proactive attitude, and always with kindness and collegiality. Any team would be lucky to have her!"

      <p class="recommendation">
        "Thoughtful, friendly, committed, positive, and responsible are a few words I can use to describe Nadine. My name is Jonatan Reyes. I am a Ph.D. candidate and a research assistant in the Applied Perception Lab at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Nadine joined our lab as an Undergraduate Summer Research Assistant during the Summer of 2022. Nadine and I worked together on a research project about user-centered design in medical imaging. Her performance throughout the different steps of research was outstanding. Nadine showed an ability to find, extract, process, evaluate, and communicate information, which are essential skills for students in academic research. Also, she demonstrated an ability to work well in teams with various backgrounds. At the end of her time in our lab, our work was published in the MICCAI Ethical and Philosophical Issues in Medical Imaging workshop. Her contribution to our team was key for the production and publication of our paper."

      <p class="recommendation">
        "I taught SOEN 357 User Interface Design Course in 2022, and Nadine was one of the markers. Nadine is a natural leader with exceptional skills in guiding my class as a marker toward achieving common goals. She is deeply passionate about addressing the underrepresentation of women in the tech industry. Her dedication to improving opportunities for women in tech is unparalleled, and her leadership skills have been instrumental in the success of many duties for which she was responsible. I have no doubt that she will continue to make significant contributions to the tech industry and inspire others to do the same."
