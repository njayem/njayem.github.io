## About Me

### Academic Background ‚ú®
My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) in Software Engineering from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/). This degree equipped me with a strong foundation in problem solving, which I am now applying in my Master's thesis research at Concordia University and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en), under the supervision of [Dr. Mirco Ravanelli](https://sites.google.com/site/mircoravanelli/) and [Dr. Marta Kersten-Oertel](https://www.concordia.ca/next-gen/kersten-oertel.html). My research focuses on the intersection of AI and healthcare, specifically exploring how machine learning algorithms can improve the accuracy of medical detection systems. This area of study has the potential to revolutionize healthcare outcomes, a cause I am proud to contribute to. Earlier this year, I had the privilege of receiving the highly competitive [NSERC CGS-M](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSM-BESCM_eng.asp) tri-agency federal award to pursue my Master's, further solidifying my commitment to the field. 

### Tech Stewardship, AI Ethics and Social Justice üèõÔ∏è
As a committed [Tech Steward](https://credentials.techstewardship.com/en/verify/88109651148606), I strive to advance my understanding of AI bias and promote the ethical development of this transformative technology. By continuously deepening my knowledge, challenging limited narratives, and practicing deliberate values, I aim to shape a more responsible and inclusive technological future. I enjoy using technology for social transformation and exploring its potential to address pressing social issues. I am committed to ensuring that data collection is inclusive, integrating the perspectives of those being studied into the process, and making data accessible to all.

### Climate Change Initiatives ‚ôªÔ∏è
Other research interests include leveraging machine learning to address Climate Change, a cause deeply important to me. This focus not only tackles environmental concerns but also aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), highlighting how addressing Climate Change can solve multiple global issues. My journey in sustainability has been ongoing, and I have actively pursued sustainability initiatives at Concordia University since 2019. This commitment led me to participate in a hands-on AI for Climate Change program through [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/), where I'm witnessing the transformative power of Machine Learning to analyze climate data and influence environmental policy through actionable insights.

### Research Experience üîç
In 2022, I received an [NSERC USRA](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/USRA-BRPC_eng.asp) federal award to pursue a research project under the supervision of Dr. Marta Kersten-Oertel at her Applied Perception Lab in Montreal, Quebec. The project focused on identifying and addressing surgeons' workflow challenges, developing Ventriculostomy prototypes to improve surgical workflow efficiency. The project culminated in a [publication](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-23223-7_5) for [MICCAI's 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/MICCAI2022-WORKSHOPS.html) [EPIMI](https://sites.google.com/view/epimi) workshop, where my team and I presented a comprehensive User-Centered Design approach to identify and address Ventriculostomy surgeons' workflow challenges to improve surgical efficiency.

As an advocate for social justice, I‚Äôm passionate about AI applications that drive social impact. At the [Applied Perception Lab](https://ap-lab.ca/), I research AI, ethics, and EDI, developing frameworks to address societal challenges and promote responsible healthcare technology. I‚Äôm also conducting research in Deep Learning for Conversational AI at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/nadine-el-mufti), focusing on early disease detection through speech analysis to improve diagnostic accuracy.

## Reimplementing and Reproducing Machine Learning Research Papers

I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).
