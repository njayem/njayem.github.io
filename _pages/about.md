    Parkinson‚Äôs disease affects individuals from all walks of life, often around the age of 60. Yet, in the struggles of those affected, research tends to amplify men's voices over others. <strong>‚ÄúThrough her Voice‚Äù</strong> transforms silence into a symphony. A woman‚Äôs lips become a voice recorder, capturing untold stories in the tremble of her voice. Behind her sits a wall of vertical speech waves ‚Äî the same pattern that coats her lips ‚Äî symbolizing how machine learning algorithms translate voices into insights, unraveling Parkinson‚Äôs complex layers and aiding in early diagnosis. The red tulip, a symbol for Parkinson‚Äôs, honors the struggles of those affected. This piece goes beyond disease; it‚Äôs about inclusion. By recognizing diverse voices, our research bridges the gap between human fragility and technology‚Äôs potential. <em>Through her voice ‚Äî and his, and theirs ‚Äî we hear not just the disease, but hope.</em>

## About Me

### Academic Background ‚ú®
My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) in Software Engineering from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/). This degree equipped me with a strong foundation in problem-solving and critical thinking. It has also honed my creativity and my out-of-the-box thinking ‚Äî which I am now applying in my master's thesis research at Concordia University and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en), under the supervision of [Dr. Mirco Ravanelli](https://sites.google.com/site/mircoravanelli/) and [Dr. Marta Kersten-Oertel](https://www.concordia.ca/next-gen/kersten-oertel.html). My research focuses on the intersection of AI and healthcare, specifically exploring how machine learning algorithms can improve the accuracy of medical detection systems and aid in early disease detection. This area of study has the potential to revolutionize healthcare outcomes, a cause I am proud to contribute to. Alongside this, I prioritize the ethical implications of AI in healthcare, ensuring that algorithms are developed and deployed in ways that are fair, transparent, and designed to achieve equitable outcomes. Earlier this year, I had the privilege of receiving the highly competitive [NSERC CGS-M](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSM-BESCM_eng.asp) tri-agency federal award to pursue my Master's, further solidifying my commitment to the field. 

### Shaping Technology and Research with Ethics, Accountability, and Inclusion üèõÔ∏è
As a committed [Tech Steward](https://credentials.techstewardship.com/en/verify/88109651148606), I strive to advance my understanding of systemic bias in tech and promote the ethical development of transformative technologies. By deepening my knowledge, challenging limited narratives, and practicing deliberate values, I aim to shape a more responsible and inclusive technological future. I am dedicated to using technology for social transformation and addressing pressing social issues. In addition to my work in tech ethics, I hold a [TCPS 2: CORE-2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rCDIrcQ7AjrW7oXkmqn8QLVimUWgWjr2/view?usp=sharing) certification in research ethics, focusing on the ethical conduct of research involving human participants. This certification reinforces my commitment to conducting data collection in an inclusive, ethical, and transparent manner, while incorporating diverse perspectives to achieve equitable outcomes.

### Climate Change Initiatives ‚ôªÔ∏è
Other research interests include leveraging machine learning to address Climate Change, a cause deeply important to me. This focus not only tackles environmental concerns but also aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), highlighting how addressing Climate Change can solve multiple global issues. My journey in sustainability has been ongoing, and I have actively pursued sustainability initiatives at Concordia University since 2019. This commitment led me to participate in a hands-on AI for Climate Change program through [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/), where I'm witnessing the transformative power of Machine Learning to analyze climate data and influence environmental policy through actionable insights.

### Research Experience üîç
In 2022, I received an [NSERC USRA](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/USRA-BRPC_eng.asp) federal award to pursue a research project under the supervision of Dr. Marta Kersten-Oertel at her Applied Perception Lab in Montreal, Quebec. The project focused on identifying and addressing surgeons' workflow challenges, developing Ventriculostomy prototypes to improve surgical workflow efficiency. The project culminated in a [publication](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-23223-7_5) for [MICCAI's 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/MICCAI2022-WORKSHOPS.html) [EPIMI](https://sites.google.com/view/epimi) workshop, where my team and I presented a comprehensive User-Centered Design approach to identify and address Ventriculostomy surgeons' workflow challenges to improve surgical efficiency.

As an advocate for social justice, I‚Äôm passionate about AI applications that drive social impact. At the [Applied Perception Lab](https://ap-lab.ca/), I conduct research at the intersection of AI, ethics, and EDI, developing frameworks to address societal challenges and promote responsible healthcare technology. Additionally, at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/nadine-el-mufti), I‚Äôm conducting novel research in Medical Machine Learning, focusing on early disease detection through speech analysis to improve diagnostic accuracy.

<!-- # Current Projects

## Reimplementing and Reproducing Machine Learning Research Papers

I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).
