## About Me

### Academic Background ‚ú®
My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) in Software Engineering from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/). This degree equipped me with a strong foundation in software development, which I am now applying in my Master's thesis research at Concordia. My research focuses on the intersection of AI and healthcare, specifically exploring how machine learning algorithms can improve the accuracy of medical detection systems. This area of study has the potential to revolutionize healthcare outcomes, a cause I am proud to contribute to. Earlier this year, I had the privilege of receiving the highly competitive [NSERC CGS-M](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSM-BESCM_eng.asp) tri-agency federal award to pursue my Master's, further solidifying my commitment to the field. 

### Tech Stewardship and AI Ethics üèõÔ∏è
As a committed [Tech Steward](https://credentials.techstewardship.com/en/verify/88109651148606), I strive to advance my understanding of AI bias and promote the ethical development of this transformative technology. By continuously deepening my knowledge, challenging limited narratives, and practicing deliberate values, I aim to shape a more responsible and inclusive technological future.

### Climate Change Initiatives ‚ôªÔ∏è
Other research interests include leveraging machine learning to address Climate Change, a cause deeply important to me. This focus not only tackles environmental concerns but also aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), highlighting how addressing Climate Change can solve multiple global issues. My journey in sustainability has been ongoing, and I have actively pursued sustainability initiatives at Concordia University since 2019. This commitment led me to participate in a hands-on AI for Climate Change program through [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/), where I'm witnessing the transformative power of Machine Learning to analyze climate data and influence environmental policy through actionable insights.

### Research Experience üîç
In 2022, I co-published a [conference paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-23223-7_5) after receiving an [NSERC USRA](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/USRA-BRPC_eng.asp) federal award to pursue a research project under the supervision of Dr. Marta Kersten-Oertel at her [Applied Perception Lab](https://ap-lab.ca/) in Montreal, Quebec. The project focused on identifying and addressing surgeons' workflow challenges, developing Ventriculostomy prototypes to improve surgical workflow efficiency. The project culminated in a conference paper for [MICCAI's 2022](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/MICCAI2022-WORKSHOPS.html) [EPIMI](https://sites.google.com/view/epimi) workshop, where my team and I presented a comprehensive User-Centered Design approach to identify and address Ventriculostomy surgeons' workflow challenges to improve surgical efficiency.


### Freelance Work üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
Inspired by this research experience, I now freelance in my free time as a UX/UI designer, creating captivating and user-friendly interfaces that bridge the gap between beauty and usability.

<!-- # Current Projects

## Reimplementing and Reproducing Machine Learning Research Papers

I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).
